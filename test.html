        <h3>How to Test the Extension:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure the Text-to-Speech Reader extension is installed</li>
            <li>Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar</li>
            <li>Configure your voice settings</li>
            <li>Click "Start Reading" to test the functionality</li>
            <li>Try the floating controls by clicking "Show Floating Controls"</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="test-content">
        <h2>Sample Content for Testing</h2>
        
        <p>This is a test page to verify that the Text-to-Speech Reader Chrome extension is working correctly. The extension should be able to read this content aloud when activated.</p>
        
        <p>The extension uses the Web Speech API to convert text to speech. It intelligently extracts the main content from web pages while excluding navigation elements, advertisements, and other non-content areas.</p>
        
        <h3>Features to Test:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice selection from available system voices</li>
            <li>Speed adjustment (0.5x to 2x)</li>
            <li>Pitch adjustment (0.5 to 2)</li>
            <li>Volume control (0 to 1)</li>
            <li>Floating controls that can be moved around the screen</li>
            <li>Progress tracking through the content</li>
            <li>Navigation between text chunks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The extension should automatically detect this main content area and read it aloud. The floating controls provide additional functionality like play/pause, stop, and navigation between different sections of the text.</p>
        
        <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
        <p>This extension is built using Manifest V3 and includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A popup interface for configuration</li>
            <li>A content script that runs on web pages</li>
            <li>A background service worker for extension management</li>
            <li>Floating controls that can be dragged around the page</li>
            <li>Settings persistence using Chrome's storage API</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If everything is working correctly, you should hear this content being read aloud when you activate the extension. The voice should be clear and the reading should be smooth and natural.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="test-content">
        <h2>Additional Test Content</h2>
        <p>This is additional content to test the chunking functionality. The extension splits long content into manageable chunks for better control and navigation.</p>
        <p>You should be able to navigate between different chunks using the floating controls. The progress bar should show your current position in the content.</p>
